# MyPalindromeMaker

Welcome to my Palindrome Maker project

To use, just open [DrorsPalindromesMaker.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DrorNeumeier/MyPalindromeMaker/blob/main/DrorsPalindromesMaker.ipynb) in google colab and follow the instructions. 

My name is Dror Neumeier. I am a high school senior at JCHS. I was inspired to write this palindrome maker for an essay. In truth, palindromes are just accidents of language; there's nothing inherently special or magical about them. Therefore, as an engineering-minded person, my first inclination was to build a machine to solve the problem for me. My approach involves two steps. The first one randomly generates a palindrome by recursively searching a language tree. I then use an NLP model called BERT to identify palindromes that sound good. 

I got a lot of questions about GPT recently. GPT is a generative model and I am not using a generative model here. Additionally I think that using GPT3 for this would be cheating because the styles are pre-embedded and you don't need to crosstrain it and that's the interesting part.

Enjoy

PS.

Thank you to my father for letting me use his account and loading 10 WHOLE dollars for me to use on Google Colab.
