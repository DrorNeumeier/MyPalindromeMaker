and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure

your mariners are muleteers reapers people ingrossd by swift impress
they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets
making a sermon of continency to her and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul knows not which way to stand to look to speak
these lies are like their father that begets them gross as a mountain open palpable
bid mistress tearsheet come to my master
came you from the king my lord
