and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight
consider the work of god
and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward

he will say why then believed ye him not
to the end that the children of israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field even that they may bring them unto the lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest and offer them for peace offerings unto the lord
and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand
and this is the number of them
then saith he unto me see thou do it not
and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail
did not i weep for him that was in trouble
for our sakes no doubt this is written
and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts

and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour
from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and by it there is profit to them that see the sun
and all the upright in heart shall glory
therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day
as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
did not i serve with thee for rachel

and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel

and i brought your fathers out of egypt
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die
and they were offended at him
are thy days as the days of man
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together
if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good and also that he have no burial
and she said lie with me
and he made him drunk
and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the kings house

and gad and reuben and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east which moses the servant of the lord gave them

shout o daughter of jerusalem
but ye have made it a den of thieves

and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir
who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob

and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire
and they arose and went to ziph before saul
and there shall be no night there
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king

and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings palace
we are true men thy servants are no spies
it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle
because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me
lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street
if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity
then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise
all the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god

i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
and of naaman the family of the naamites
and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me
and i will establish my covenant with thee

ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge
so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day
thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers
when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait

and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years
and azel had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheru and ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan
for they are white already to harvest
for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned

and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
and he trode her under foot
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north
for she hath wrought a good work upon me
and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him
i stand up and thou regardest me not
the sons of japheth
i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak
and let his house be made a dunghill for this

the lord hath not sent thee
blessed is the man that endureth temptation
and here is the mind which hath wisdom
for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid
so joab came to the king and told him
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but little in
and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel
and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns

of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
and the sons of ethan
and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop
thy nobles shall dwell in the dust
therefore have i uttered that i understood not
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold
for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him
for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away
for he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people
but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it

but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron
and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth

so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar
twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers
also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied
turn you at my reproof
they perish for ever without any regarding it
and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary
therefore will i give her cup into thine hand
kedesh with her suburbs daberath with her suburbs
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together
he will not always chide
the hand of the diligent shall bear rule
for all israel were come to shechem to make him king
whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
so shalt thou put away evil from israel
and the lord shewed me four carpenters
and i will harden pharaohs heart that he shall follow after them

where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt
have ye your heart yet hardened
there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked
and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat
but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god
every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord
he said again give the people that they may eat
and jacob sojourned in the land of ham
the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men
now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest

in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures
and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish
for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience

and josephs master took him and put him into the prison a place where the kings prisoners were bound
and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up
wherefore will ye plead with me
and husham died and hadad the son of bedad who smote midian in the field of moab reigned in his stead
notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast and of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed
forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him
for who hath resisted his will
speak unto the children of israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts
how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand
and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the lord he took one unleavened cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder
and behold thou seest it
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased
for he hath a certain thing to tell him
the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee

for every house is builded by some man

know ye not that we shall judge angels
the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people
and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be
and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground which i have separated from you as unclean
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem
whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham
his shaft and his branches his bowls his knops and his flowers shall be of the same
and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them
and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah

he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth
and the woman took the child and nursed it
and they shall take a cloth of blue and cover the candlestick of the light and his lamps and his tongs and his snuffdishes and all the oil vessels thereof wherewith they minister unto it

it shall be an abomination and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity
therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water
hath thy soul lothed zion
and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing
i will nourish you and your little ones
and the lord spake unto joshua saying
now joshua was old and stricken in years
for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry
but on the spoil laid they not their hand

fill their faces with shame
o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength
the righteous see it and are glad

and moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto aaron and to his sons according to the word of the lord as the lord commanded moses
ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl

it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princes
the king of eglon one
none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth

therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants
and out of the tribe of naphtali
and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near
for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman
and ye now therefore have sorrow

a time of war and a time of peace
except we should go and buy meat for all this people

thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
both the great and the small shall die in this land
and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters
and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
and he made as though he would have gone further
and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars
yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them

and the woman was very beautiful to look upon
and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts their god
deal thus with them in the time of thine anger
and they feared when they heard that they were romans
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house
be troubled ye careless ones
for a blessing is in it
and the lord said unto me son of man mark well and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the laws thereof
ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left
but i forsook not thy precepts
and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam
then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord
and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you
and he said take the arrows
moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord
the lord is with them that uphold my soul
